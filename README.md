# Group 6 - MIST 4610 Group Project #1 - Music Industry Data Model

This project models a database for the music industry, including record labels, artists, songs, albums, awards, concerts, and fans. This database shows how the different entities interact with each other in the world. Each entity has its own unique qualities but is related to other entities in this environment and is used to push the music industry forward. We also demonstrate practical SQL queries for this model to show how it can be used in a real-world context.
